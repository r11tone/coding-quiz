# <Coding-Quiz>

## Description

For this assignment I used bootstrap to create a good base for my quiz which explains the lack of "css". The objective was to build a quiz with a timer. The entire quiz is timed as soon as you click the "start quiz" button. If you answer a question wrong it removes time off of the quiz. If the answer is correct it adds time. This process will decipher the amount of points recieved on the quiz. After completion of the quiz you can input your high score and click "back" to take you to the home screen. Now the scores are logged in the system and can be viewed by clicking the "view highscores" button.

## Installation

I created variables for each element and called them using the querySelector. I then used a variable to create the questions, choices for the questions, and the correct answer. I used EventListeners to create the click function and told it to hide other elements to only show the next question or screen.

## Usage

To use this app, click the start quiz button to activate the quiz questions. Select the answer you believe is true or correct before the timer runs out. After the quiz questions are completed you may log your high score to save it or clear the high score and go back to the home page.
